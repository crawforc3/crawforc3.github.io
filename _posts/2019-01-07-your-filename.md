## Cold tolerance in tomatoes

Here are my notes for cold tolerance in tomatoes

- Germination speed is a thing
- converting metric to imperial is a thing
  -  0C  = 32F
  - 10C = 50F
  - 20C = 68F
  - 21C ~ 70F
  - 40C = 104F
  - 50C = 122F
  - 100C = 212F
  
  - High altitude varieties might be good for growing on the porch
  
 This looks fun:
